Here is a list of events from a story. We want you to convert them into an event graph which contains nodes and edges. Each node represents an event, and each edge represents the causal connection between two events.

Example Input:
Event 0: When Dan goes to school in the morning, he has to take the bus.
Event 1: One day Dan was running late, and missed the bus to school.
Event 2: Dan called his friend Pete, and asked for a ride to school.
Event 3: Pete gave Dan a ride to school, but Dan was late to his first class.
Event 4: Luckily Dan wasn't late to any of his other classes that day.
Example Output:

Example Input:
Event 0: Alice was a sweet girl, but she was also very sneaky.
Event 1: When she thought her teacher wasn't paying attention, she would be bad
Event 2: She would say bad words and tell other kids bad things.

Example Input:
Event 0: Gina needed to get out of traffic.
Event 1: She spotted a side street she could turn down.
Event 2: But the side street was still 5 cars up.
Event 3: Gina had to wait for her chance to turn off the street.
Event 4: The only question was to take a left, or a right.
