Score the following storyline given the beginning of the story with one to five stars.
Where one star means "Nonsense",
two stars mean "The storyline has some causal connections with the beginning, but is not understandable",
three stars mean "The storyline has some causal connections with the beginning and is understandable",
four stars mean "The storyline is causally consistent with the beginning and possibly involves a few grammar mistakes",
and five stars mean "Perfect storyline with causal connections and perfect grammar".

We also provide causal connections analyzed by experts, where each event is represented as a node, and the causal connections between these nodes are listed.

Here are two examples:
Example1:
The beginning of the story: A cat crosses my path on the street.
Storyline: Intrigued, I decide to buy a cup of coffee. While sipping it, I notice a peculiar cloud in the sky. Suddenly, my phone rings, and it's a wrong number. The day continues without any apparent connection between events.
Event graph: 
Edge 0: (Node 0 -> Node 1)
Stars: 2

Example2:
The beginning of the story: I woke up today feeling bored.
Storyline: I decided to do some chores around the house. But I quickly got tired. Later, I ate a sandwich and watched TV. Nothing interesting happened today.
Event graph: 
Edge 0: (Node 0 -> Node 1)
Edge 1: (Node 1 -> Node 2)
Edge 2: (Node 2 -> Node 3)
Edge 3: (Node 3 -> Node 4)
Stars: 4.5
